# Service Layer Rules
- Service files should be created only under folder 'backend/service', backend directory is relative to project root folder.
- Data cache files should be created only under folder 'backend/cache' backend directory is relative to project root folder.
- All business logic must be implemented here and should not reside in the API layer.
- First implement logic using dummy data cache, state is maintained by the data cache.
- Services interacts with ORM layer for actual data retrieval.
- Should have capability to switch between dummy data versus actual data from ORM layer.
