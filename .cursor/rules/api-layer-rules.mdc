- APIs implemented using FastAPI library
- API files should be created only under folder 'backend/api', backend directory is relative to project root folder.
- API should integrate with the Service layer. If there is no Service Layer defined for the new APIs, refer to Service Layer rules in building Service Layer.
- Cursor AI should ensure OpenAPI documentation is generated.
- Error handling should be implemented before exposing any API endpoint.
